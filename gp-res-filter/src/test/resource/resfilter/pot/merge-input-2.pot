"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. "
"Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, "
"when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type "
"specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into "
"electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised "
"in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum "
"passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus "
"PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
